I am a recent PhD graduate of the <a href="http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/">Joint Carnegie Mellon/University of Pittsburgh PhD program for Computational Biology</a>, where I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/">Prof. David Ryan Koes</a>. My research expertise lies in enhancing the representations of protein-ligand interactions with a focus on structure-based methods. This has involved exploring various computational drug discovery approaches, including virtual screening, docking, and binding affinity prediction.

I am passionate about leveraging deep learning and computational methods to advance the drug discovery pipeline, as demonstrated by my collaboration with <a href="https://www.pharmacy.pitt.edu/people/christian-fernandez">Christian Fernandez's Lab at the University of Pittsburgh</a>, where we discovered a novel inhibitor of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-Cells 2 (NFATC2) (published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2024.1397995">Frontiers in Pharmacology</a>).

### Research Interests:
* Drug Discovery
* Deep Learning
* Structural Biology
* Metric Learning
* Self-Supervised Learning

I graduated from Purdue University with honors in 2019 with a double major in Physics and Mathematics.

### Other Interests
When I am not doing research I enjoy cooking, baking, and fermenting (Checkout my <a href="https://github.com/drewnutt/CookBook">Cookbook</a>). My other time is spent outdoors enjoying nature while <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201243476">climbing</a>, hiking, and camping.
