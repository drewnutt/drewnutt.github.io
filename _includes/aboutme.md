I am a 6th year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.compbio.cmu.edu/">Joint Carnegie Mellon/University of Pittsburgh program for Computational Biology</a>. I am working in <a href="https://bits.csb.pitt.edu/">Prof David Ryan Koes's</a> lab. My research focuses on enhancing deep learning models for drug discovery. 

### Research Interests:
